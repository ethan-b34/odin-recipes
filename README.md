# odin-recipes
This is a basic recipe website where I am going to be practicing my html skills
as part of the foundations course in theodinproject.

I am going to be displaying my understanding of HTML and git core principles.

Once I have finished this project I will update this README.md file and use
it as a self-reflection post.
